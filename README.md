## Putting the Web first
[Ruben Verborgh](https://ruben.verborgh.org/)'s talk at [SemWeb.Pro 2016](http://semweb.pro/semwebpro-2016.html).

The original vision for the Semantic Web was deeply rooted in the World Wide Web.
However, along the way, we seem to have shifted our focus to topics such as data analysis.
And how does the Semantic Web hold up against Big Data and Machine Learning,
which arguably have been the more hot topics lately?
In this talk, I'll explain why the “Web” part of “Semantic Web” is so important,
and why we need to think in a much more decentralized way.
If we want the Semantic Web to be succeed for real users,
it has to work on a Web scale.
